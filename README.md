### Ahoy-hoy! 👋

You'll find all sorts in here - to be slightly more coherent than `/dev/urandom`, that's the goal. I would say private or proprietary repo's are where the treasures are at, but depends on what you class as 'treasure', yarr... yarrr.

I'm a full stack by trade, mainly focusing in Laravel (& Filament), but I dabble in everything. I have a pretty serious homelab and tinker with the latest in the land of DevOps, from bare metal hardware (building servers and custom builds) to hypervisors and above. I enjoy playing with mobile and desktop native experiences, and any language that I need to get stuff done, so you'll often see me contributing and getting stuck in with anything and everything. Basically anything with a plug socket I'm down to play around with, take apart, learn and have an interest in tinkering with. Tech, and its history, leads my curiosity!

Be kind, and have an adventure. ♥️
